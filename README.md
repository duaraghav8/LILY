# Lion-Identification-Loss-less-Yield

**Intro**

Lion Identification Loss less Yield or LILY is a Digital Image Processing based Software Project developed for Scientists at the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) for the purpose of conducting Lion Census.

The project has been programmed entirely in Python 3.4 with support of PILLOW Image processing Library. Works perfectly on Windows, but I haven't tested it for Linux or Mac.

**NOTE**
  1. There has been negligible focus on security, since it wasn't really a concern. The Login Screen and credentials database are just a mere formality. The application simply checks for the existence of a particular environment variable based on which, it will allow access to the main engine.
  2. Pardon the occasional freezing of the Application. I'm a bit of a noob when it comes to multithreading, so I handled it quite poorly.

**Installing and Running**

Copy the folder in your work Directory. Open up CMD. Switch to the Application's directory and run lily_login.py like:

python lily_login.py

(make sure your PATH Environment Variable is configured to point to the Python 3 Directory).
